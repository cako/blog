<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Summary</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">Marine (coastal and ocean) environments are fundamental features of the Earth system that are profoundly influenced by human interactions. As these ecosystems are trans-boundary and multi-dimensional the policy instruments governing the utilization of coastal ocean systems are complex. However, policies, laws and regulations are often disconnected to the scale and dynamics of targeted ecosystems and species in both time and space (e.g. oceanographic processes, migratory species, multi-site life stages). Many global to local scale policies can be more effective, support deeper understanding of ecosystem processes, and take into account cumulative impacts of social pressures and environmental change, when viewed through an ecosystem lens from the past and looking ahead. Additionally, as technology advances, human population increases and energy demands combine to extend the horizons of marine exploration and exploitation further offshore, a robust understanding of policies impacts and ecology responses in coastal-ocean realms is increasingly vital.<br />
<br />
This course uses case studies to gain an understanding of marine conservation measure and spatial planning to explore linkages between different scales of coastal-ocean ecosystem processes and ecological dynamics in connection with applicable scales of policy instruments (e.g. Law of the Sea, Convention of Biodiversity, UNESCO World Heritage; regional conventions; Local codes and policies framed around fishing regulations, coastal zoning, and traditional knowlege). Diverse case studies across a range of biomes, scales, and issues are considered to examine and test the suitability of different policies for different ecosystem scales, environmental issues and socio-cultural contexts. Examples of case study scales include: Archipelagos and Islands, Estuaries, Semi-enclosed Seas, Continental Margins, Polar Seas, and Global Oceans.<br />
<br />
While most courses in GeoSciences are terrestrial in orientation, this course is focuses on marine ecosystems, issues and policies in an integrated way that provides foundational learning for critical analysis of marine environments and human impacts. This course will help prepare students for positions in governments, NGOs, environmental consultancies and private enterprise requiring competency at the science-policy interface.<br />
(Note: This course is co-taught as a 20c course for (PGT only) and 10c for a small number of fourth year Env GeoScience and Ecology, with joint lecture sessions. The PGT 20c has additional discussion groups and journal response assignments. Group Presentations will be presented by both 10c and 20c groupings, with all attending. Both 10c and 20c will have individual policy position papers.)</td>

<tr>
<td class="rowhead1" width ="15%">Course description</td><td width="85%" colspan="99">
    
    The first part of the course has lectures on different marine biomes, followed by exemplary case studies from academic staff and guest lectures from government and NGO organizations. Together these illustrate a range of issues and societal contexts through which different policies will be examined. Building on lectures and case studies, students will conduct their own case-study policy analysis though group presentations and an individual essay.

<caption>Reading List</caption> 
<tr><td>For our guides along the way, we will be using Marine Ecology: Processes, Systems, and Impacts, 2nd ed., by Michel Kaiser, et al.  While this text book is not required, it is highly recommended and some copies will likely be available in the main Central Library and the KB Library, and for purchase from a bookstore of your choice (e.g. Blackwells in Edinburgh, Amazon etc). We also utilize relevant chapters from the 2014 Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).  While the textbook provides an ongoing and consistent backdrop to the course, we primarily use engage with a preliminary set of core readings from academic journal articles as indicated below.  In addition, we will provide further topical readings on the different biomes and case studies along the way, building a ¿marine library¿ for your use in this class and beyond.  <br />
