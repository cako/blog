The dynamic character of the Earth System is not only responsible for our own existence, but also for inevitable natural hazards. This course will introduce the Earth System as a basis for characterising and understanding natural hazards, their causes and consequences.  The major types of natural hazard will be described, analysed and assessed in terms of their underlying causes as well as their socio-economic and environmental impacts. This course capitalises on natural synergies between subsurface, surface and human dimensions of the Earth System. Hazards to be considered will include earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic hazards (local, regional and global scale), meteorological hazards (hurricanes, tornados, dust storms, El Nino, flooding and coastal erosion), topographic hazards such as landslides, and hazards arising from climate change. The evidence for past natural catastrophes and hazards, recorded in natural archives, will be described along with remote sensing methods for documenting current hazards and hazard risk. The principles and application of risk assessment and analysis will be considered with respect to case studies. The Course comprises 20 lectures supplemented by a series of laboratory classes, together with a directed programme of reading. The Course is assessed by degree examination together with a course project and class exercises.</td>

Written Exam: 50%, Course Work: 50 %, Practical Exam: 0%.<br />
<br />
The Course comprises 20 one-hour lectures that are supplemented by a series of 10 one-hour practicals (tutorial and feedback) together with four hand-in exercises, a course project and directed programme of reading. <br />
<br />
The Course is assessed by:<br />
(a)	a two-hour degree examination (50%) <br />
(b)	4 hand-in exercises (30%)<br />
(c)	Course project (20%) on one of 3 prescribed topics.<br />
<br />
Degree examinations<br />
There is a 2-hour Degree examination in December.<br />
- The total degree marks are made up of the Degree Exam in December (50%), course project (20%) and from practical exercises (30%).<br />
- The overall pass mark is 40% but in order to pass the course your marks in the exam and the coursework must each be at least 40%. A mark of »50% in one component will not compensate for a mark of «30% in the other. It will not be possible for you to resit the coursework components and so your existing coursework marks will be used for resit purposes. This means that you will not be able to pass the resit exam if your aggregate coursework mark is «40% (i.e. you will have to resit the whole course).<br />
- Example exam papers are available to help with your revision.<br />
- The School is empowered to withdraw your right to sit degree examinations if you have persistently failed to carry out the work of the course without good reason. Persistent failure to attend lectures, failure to attend practical classes or to hand in reports on time will be taken as evidence of inadequate performance unless an acceptable reason is given: normally a medical certificate is required in case of illness.<br />
<br />
Assessment deadlines<br />
Each class exercise will be completed over two practical sessions and will be handed in on completion. The first of these will be for formative feedback, the subsequent 4 exercises will be part of the course assessment. The exercises will be handed in, in hard copy, to the Teaching Office in the Grant Institute, every second Monday by 2pm.</td>

<caption>Learning Outcomes</caption> 
<tr>
<td>    By the end of this course, students will be able to demonstrate a broad knowledge of the main natural hazards and therefore be capable of recognising, defining and describing the variety and diversity of natural hazards that affect the Earth's surface environments. Students will be capable of explaining the relationships between geohazards (earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanism, slope collapse), active tectonic processes expressed on the Earth's surface and underlying processes in the Earth. They will also be able to understand and explain the relationships between meteorological hazards and the underlying physical processes operating in the atmosphere.  Using routine techniques in natural hazard analysis (natural and historical records and remote sensing of present-day images) students will develop an appreciation of the incidence and significance of impacts as hazards both at present and in the past. An appreciation of the basic principles of risk will be developed and then applied to determine the risk associated with specific types of natural hazard, in order to appreciate the complexity of dealing with these issues at the professional level. Each student will submit a course project addressing key issues in Natural Hazards.
